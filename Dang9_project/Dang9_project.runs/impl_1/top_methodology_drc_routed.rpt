2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
DPIR-1#1 Warning
Asynchronous driver check  
DSP graph_inst/ball_inst/vbx_new3__0 input pin graph_inst/ball_inst/vbx_new3__0/B[0] is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset. This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.  It is suggested to recode or change these registers to remove the reset or use a synchronous reset to get the best optimization for performance, power and area.
Related violations: <none>

DPIR-1#2 Warning
Asynchronous driver check  
DSP graph_inst/ball_inst/vbx_new4__0 input pin graph_inst/ball_inst/vbx_new4__0/B[0] is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset. This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.  It is suggested to recode or change these registers to remove the reset or use a synchronous reset to get the best optimization for performance, power and area.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell graph_inst/ball_inst/state_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) graph_inst/ball_inst/state_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
