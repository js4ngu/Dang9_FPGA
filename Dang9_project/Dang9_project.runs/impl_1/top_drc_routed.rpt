2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net graph_inst/ball1_vx_reg_reg[9]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin graph_inst/ball1_vx_reg_reg[9]_LDC_i_1/O, cell graph_inst/ball1_vx_reg_reg[9]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net graph_inst/ball1_vx_reg_reg[9]_LDC_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin graph_inst/ball1_vx_reg_reg[9]_LDC_i_2/O, cell graph_inst/ball1_vx_reg_reg[9]_LDC_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#1 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port key_io[0] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#2 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port key_io[1] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#3 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port key_io[2] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#4 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port key_io[3] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
